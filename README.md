A collection of bit-keyed collections


#   Work in Progress

This crate is a work in progress.

It is known to be incomplet and at times incorrekt. Use at your own risks.


#   Goals & Non-Goals

##  Goals

-   Provide high-level API for bit-keyed sets and maps.
-   Provide high-level algorithms to operate on these bit-keyed sets and maps.
-   Provide implementations of bit-keyed sets and maps.
-   Provide low-level abstractions upon which to build bit-keyed sets and maps.

##  Non-Goals

-   Provide all possible implementations of bit-keyed sets and maps. In particular, highly-specialized implementations
    such as roaring bit maps are best provided by dedicated crates.
